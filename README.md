Hi nice to meet you.
I am @RamsesTC12.
My hobbies are programming and I love studying new web development technologies.
I would really like to gain experience by being part of projects and contributing
to the community. Becoming a web developer is my goal. If you think I could be the
ideal candidate, I would be happy to collaborate.
The technologies that I master are: 
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
PHP
currently learning React!!!
